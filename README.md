# Research Plan:
## Avoidance Learning in Chronic Pain Patients (Behavioural)

This document is meant to serve as a method of outlining the research plan for the project Avoidance Learning in Acute and Chronic Pain Patients (Behavioural). It will outline the research goals of the project and the steps taken to achieve those goals.

This project will focus on behavioural findings, which includes descriptive and inferential statistics on accuracy and reaction times as well as the computational modeling of these data using a context-dependent reinforcement learning model and baseline reinforcement learning models. 

The overarching goal of the project is to determine whether there are differences in learning mechanisms between chronic pain patients and healthy controls. The project is modeled after Vandendriessche et al., 2023 study that investigated differences in learning between depressed individuals and healthy controls. Specifically, this study found that depressed patients had impaired reward learning in a low rewarding context in contrast to healthy controls as well as in contrast to their learning in a high rewarding context. Computational modeling revealed that this impairment is a heightened sensitivity to feedback within the low rewarding context (i.e., higher learning rates compared to control). This signifies depressed individuals have a heightened sensitivity to negative outcomes. The current project will seek to replicate the analyses conducted by this study but in the context of pain.

This project will also serve as a precursor to a project incorporating EEG with the same experimental paradigm, allowing neural differences in learning to be investigated. 

# Research Goals: 
1. Determine whether acute and/or chronic pain patients have impaired learning mechanisms compared to healthy controls. 
2. Determine whether acute and/or chronic pain patients have impaired learning in a rewarding context versus a punishing context.
