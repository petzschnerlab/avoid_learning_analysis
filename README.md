# Avoidance Learning Analysis

Welcome to the avoidance learning analysis repo. This repo was built for the PEAC lab to analyse behavioural data from the various avoidance learning tasks. This repo loads the data, conducts statistics on the data, plots the data, and generates a report as a PDF file, which presents the main findings of the study. 

See our [documentation](https://petzschnerlab.github.io/avoid_learning_analysis/).
